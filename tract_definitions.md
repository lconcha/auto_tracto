# Commissural fibers
## AC (Anterior Commissure)
The AC interconnects both temporal lobes. Selection regions are placed at the midline, where it is easily recognizable above the mamillary bodies, and on axial slices at the level of the cerebral peduncles. The lateral extent of the AC is ill-defined, as the fibers fan out as they enter/exit the temporal lobes, thus the streamlines are truncated on as they extend the equivalent of 32 mm from the midline, This level corresponds roughly to the lateral extent of the lateral ventricles. Exclusion criteria are placed anteriorly, in a coronal slice behid the posterior border of the genu of the corpus callosum; at the level of the cerebellum; and at the brain stem.

## Corpus callosum (CC)
The corpus callosum is the largest white matter structure in the brain. Obtaining a tractogram of it as a whole is a difficult task, ant it is better delineated if separated into four segments.

### FMI (Forceps minor of corpus callosum)
The FMI contains the streamlines that pass through the genu of the CC. Two inclusion criteria are placed on a coronal slice at the level of the frontal pole. Streamlines must reach both regions to be retained. An exclusion mask limits the entire midline with the exception of the genu of the CC, and also more posteriorly, with a coronal slice at the level of the crus of the fornix.

### CC_MID (Corpus Callosum middle portion)
Also known as the body of the CC, interconnects frontal and parietal lobes of one hemisphere to their counterparts in the other hemisphere. As such, selection criteria are drawn axially in the frontal and parietal lobes, and the streamlines must pass through any portion of the mid-sagittal CC. There is no need to draw the anterior and posterior boundaries of the mid-sagittal CC, as the underlying connectivity based on the inclusion criteria automatically performs this division. No streamline should travel downwards around the basal ganglia and internal capsules, nor should they enter the temporal lobe.

### FMA (Forceps major of corpus callosum)
The FMA contains the streamlines that pass through the splenium of the CC. Similarly to the FMI, two inclusion regions are placed coronally at each side of the midline, but in the occipital pole. The exlusion criteria includes the midline, but allows the entire CC (no anterior border of the CC is explicitly defined in the exclusion mask), and two regions on a coronal slice at the level of the splenium avoids streamlines going to the temporal lobe, as those constitute the tapetum.

### TAPETUM
The tapetum contains the streamlines that interconnect the temporal lobes throgh the splenium of the CC. The entire CC is used as an inclusion region, and also one at each hemisphere, coronally, at the level of the temporal lobe. Exclusion regions in the cingulum avoid having contamination from CGH.


# Association fibers
## AF (Arcuate Fasciculus)
The AF connects the temporal and frontal lobes.  An inclusion region is placed coronally at the level of the corona radiata around the low-FA region where the CC and AF are known to cross, and on an axial slice at the level of the temporo-parietal junction.

## FA (Frontal aslant)
## FX (Fornix)
Streamlines of the FX interconnect the hippocampus and the mamillary body of the same hemisphere. Inclusion regions are placed at the hippocampus, and in the crus of the FX, where it is easily observed just above the thalamus, surrounded by CSF. Exclusion criteria avoid fibers that enter the AC and extend laterally. The commissural portion of the FX (*psalterium* or *Lyra Davidis*) is not included in this bundle.

## IFOF (Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus)
This very long bundle connects the frontal and occipital lobes. While bundle fans out at each lobe, the streamlines converge in a very discrete portion in the superior aspect of the temporal lobe, just inferior to the external capsule. This is near where streamlines of the UF bend from the temporal towards the frontal lobe, so streamlines traversing to the temporal pole are discarded. It is also common for some frontal fibers to follow the IFOF then deviate towards to the brain stem and cerebellum, but these are also discarded.

## ILF (Inferior longitudinal fasciculus)
Interconnects the temporal and occipital lobes, traveling through the middle and inferior portions of the temporal lobe, but not through the white matter related to the superior temporal gyrus. Contamination with the CGH and brain stem is avoided.

## MLF (Middle longitudinal fasciculus)
## OR (Optic radiation)
## POPT (Posterior occipito-temporal tract)
## SLF (Superior longitudinal fasciculus)
## UF (Uncinate fasciculus)
## Cingulum
### CG (Cingulum, whole)
### CGFP (Cingulum, fronto-parietal portion)
### CGH (Cingulum, parahippocampal portion)


# Projection fibers
## CST (Corticospinal tract)
