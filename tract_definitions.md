## Commissural fibers
### AC (Anterior Commissure)
The AC interconnects both temporal lobes. Selection regions are placed at the midline, where it is easily recognizable above the mamillary bodies, and on axial slices at the level of the cerebral peduncles. The lateral extent of the AC is ill-defined, as the fibers fan out as they enter/exit the temporal lobes, thus the streamlines are truncated on as they extend the equivalent of 32 mm from the midline, This level corresponds roughly to the lateral extent of the lateral ventricles. Exclusion criteria are placed anteriorly, in a coronal slice behid the posterior border of the genu of the corpus callosum; at the level of the cerebellum; and at the brain stem.

### Corpus callosum (CC)
The corpus callosum is the largest white matter structure in the brain. Obtaining a tractogram of it as a whole is a difficult task, ant it is better delineated if separated into four segments.
#### FMI (Forceps minor of corpus callosum)
The FMI contains the streamlines that pass through the genu of the CC. Two inclusion criteria are placed on a coronal slice at the level of the frontal pole. Streamlines must reach both regions to be retained. An exclusion mask limits the entire midline with the exception of the genu of the CC, and also more posteriorly, with a coronal slice at the level of the crus of the fornix.
#### CC_MID (Corpus Callosum mid-section)
**this one is wrong** it should have more includes on the left hemisphere. Do it again.
#### FMA (Forceps major of corpus callosum)
The FMA contains the streamlines that pass through the splenium of the CC. Similarly to the FMI, two inclusion regions are placed coronally at each side of the midline, but in the occipital pole. The exlusion criteria includes the midline, but allows the entire CC (no anterior border of the CC is explicitly defined in the exclusion mask), and two regions on a coronal slice at the level of the splenium avoids streamlines going to the temporal lobe, as those constitute the tapetum.
#### TAPETUM
The tapetum contains the streamlines that interconnect the temporal lobes throgh the splenium of the CC. The entire CC is used as an inclusion region, and also one at each hemisphere, coronally, at the level of the temporal lobe. Exclusion regions in the cingulum avoid having contamination from CGH. **this is incomplete, just like CC_MID**


## Association fibers
### AF (Arcuate Fasciculus)
The AF connects the temporal and frontal lobes. The AF contains three different portions, but these were not subdivided. An inclusion region is placed coronally at the level of the corona radiata around the low-FA region where the CC and AF are known to cross, and on an axial slice at the level of the temporo-parietal junction.

### FA (Frontal aslant)
### FX (Fornix)
Streamlines of the FX interconnect the hippocampus and the mamillary body of the same hemisphere. Inclusion regions are placed at the hippocampus, and in the crus of the FX, where it is easily observed just above the thalamus, surrounded by CSF. Exclusion criteria avoid fibers that enter the AC and extend laterally. The commissural portion of the FX (*psalterium* or *Lyra Davidis*) is not included in this bundle.
### IFOF (Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus)
### ILF (Inferior longitudinal fasciculus)
### MLF (Middle longitudinal fasciculus)
### OR (Optic radiation)
### POPT (Posterior occipito-temporal tract)
### SLF (Superior longitudinal fasciculus)
### UF (Uncinate fasciculus)
### Cingulum
#### CG (Cingulum, whole)
#### CGFP (Cingulum, fronto-parietal portion)
#### CGH (Cingulum, parahippocampal portion)


## Projection fibers
### CST (Corticospinal tract)
